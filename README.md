# About ajax-project
My 1st ajax project for a simple moving app using Google maps API, NYT Articles API, Wikipedia API.

Also, exercise in a graceful error handling (using `.fail()` method) of ajax events.  

## How to Use this App: 
Please open this page: https://mashablair.github.io/ajax-project/
Then simply enter an address (e.g. 100 State Street, Santa Barbara, CA) in a prompt window too see the street view of your chosen location, as well as some archived articles from NY Times.  

This code follows a Udacity lecture by Cameron Pittman ***"Intro to AJAX"***.
